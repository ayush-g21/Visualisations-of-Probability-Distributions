# Visualisations-of-Probability-Distributions
This project visualizes different continuous and discrete probability distributions with their properties.
<br>
It uses python libraries such as `Tensorflow-Probability` for various distributions. 
<br>The web app is deployed using `streamlit`.

### Files and Folders
The repository contains three files:    
* `app.py` : The main file containing the logic of all the distributions
* `plot.py`: The file for plotting the graph
* `requirements.txt` : It contains all the imported libraries.
<br>
  
### Deployment
The web app is deployed on the **Hugging Face Spaces.**
