# Visualisations-of-Probability-Distributions
This project visualizes different continuous and discrete probability distributions with their properties.
<br>
The python library `Tensorflow-Probability` is used for various distributions. 
<br>The web app is deployed using `streamlit`.

### Files and Folders
The repository contains three files:    
* `app.py` : The main file containing the logic  and algorithms of all the distributions.
* `plot.py`: The file for plotting the graph.
* `requirements.txt` : The file containing all the imported libraries.
<br>
  
### Deployment
The web app is deployed on the **Hugging Face Spaces**.
